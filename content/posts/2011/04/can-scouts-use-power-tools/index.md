Assistant Scoutmaster Michael from Troop 2000 in Brockton Mass. asks:
Can Scouts use power tools? I’m confused because I’ve been told they can’t yet the BSA guidelines say they can.
My other problem is that these guidelines are completely void of any specific information as to which tools are allowed and which ones are not.
We can find the answer to this perennial question in The Guide to Safe Scouting
As you note anyone registered as a Boy Scout (10 1/2 years old and older) or Venture is permitted to use power tools. This isn’t my opinion – it is BSA policy in black and white.
The guide is silent on which power tools because each of us is expected to use our experience and common sense in deciding which     boys use which tools. I am a carpenter by trade, so I have some     familiarity with the subject. I’d have no problem allowing most     11-year-old Scouts operate a drill, but I wouldn’t want most of     them to use a circular saw. Then again there are some     seventeen-year-old Scouts who worry me when they use a butter knife     much less a power tool.
Almost every merit badge merit badge requirement I can think of can     be completed with hand tools – a bit slower, yes, but they can be     completed. You’ll also note that they have a safety element built     in. Here’s the first requirement for woodworking MB:
1. Do the following:
a. Show that you know first aid for injuries that could occur         while woodworking, including splinters, scratches, cuts, severe           bleeding, and shock.         Tell what precautions must be taken to help prevent loss of eyesight or hearing, and explain why and when         it is necessary to use a dust mask.
b. Earn the Totin’ Chip recognition.
c. Tell your counselor what precautions you take to safely use         your tools.
You’ll make safety a strong part of your counseling.
There is one exception to this rule – using chain saws on Council property; operators must be 18 years and older and complete a training session. But you don’t need a chainsaw to complete any Merit Badge I know of.
As for those who tell you that Scouts are prohibited from using     power tools ask them to show you the prohibition in writing in an     official BSA document. They won’t find it.
You can further demonstrate that     Scouts are, indeed, permitted to use power tools in the Guide to     Safe Scouting. You can then go on to point out that Woodworking     merit badge requires you to teach how to use hearing protection and     dust masks; why would one need that if Scouts were not permitted to     use power tools?
Thanks for volunteering to counsel merit badges – it is great fun.     If I can help you with any other questions about this do let me     know.
