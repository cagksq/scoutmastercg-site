Over time, processes that seek to decrease entropy and create order are valued, but improving them gets more difficult as well. If you're seeking to make the organized more organized, it's a tough row to hoe.
Far easier and more productive to create productive chaos, to interrupt, re-create, produce, invent and redefine.
Seth Godin
Most of our work as Scoutmasters is like hiking a trail; start here and end up there. But things are not always that simple and organized. It's not always a steady pace forward. We start, stop, regroup, retreat, advance, turn around, sit down, stand still, walk, run, crawl, limp, saunter; but at least most of the time we are doing something.
There's a fair amount of productive chaos in Scouting (two words not often associated with one another). As a matter of fact we are specialists in productive chaos. Ideally our plans proceed in a straight, well disciplined line but that's hardly ever the case.
Leadership is interrupting, re-creating, inventing and redefining. Yesterday's plan may not work today. While the destination doesn't change the way we get there does.
