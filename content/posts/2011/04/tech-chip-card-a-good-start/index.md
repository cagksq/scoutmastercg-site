Here's an interesting resource that offers a way to integrate Scouting with portable technology:
Tech Chip
Based on the Tote'n Chip concept. It was created by Troop
479 in Eden Prairie, MN. The troop has designed a training outline and
has wallet cards for purchase – see
Tech Chip Training Plan
for details.
Great minds travel on the same track. I
mentioned the need for something like this a year or so ago
and tried to interest one of my Scouts in drawing something up but he never got too far with the idea.
I think the folks at 479 have done a good job of identifying four simple guidelines;
1. Electronics are not used after “Lights Out”.
2. Electronics are used when there are no other activities or responsibilities.
3. Electronics are used when it does not affect anyone else.
4. You are completely responsible for the device you bring.
I'd like to work on 2 and 3 a bit. What about emergencies or when the device is part of the activity (like a GPS)? Emergency use is especially important, who calls who and when? One of my Scouts once called home on his cell to tell his mother how cold he was and she was driven to distraction with worry until he came home. Does there need to be a parent part of this too?
We want to encourage considerate use in all situations in and out of Scouting. Perhaps we can contribute to the overall deportment of our culture by raising people who use cellphones less rudely.
I support the idea of inegrating technology into Scouting, it is going to happen and we'd better be thinking about it. Kudos to Troop 479 for making a good start.
