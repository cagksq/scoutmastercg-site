      <description>&lt;p&gt;My first reaction to this title was “yeah, right”. I’ve been a camper all my life spending a thousand or more nights under canvas or on the trail. My camping education started forty years ago with Colin Fletcher’s book ‘The Complete Walker’ and expanded to the classics written by Horace Kephart, Nessmuk, and Bradford Angier. I thought I knew all the tricks until I read ‘Camping’s Top Secrets’.&#xA;Cliff Jacobsen’s collection of techniques and ideas have been tested over many years of guiding canoe trips in northern Canada. Creating a comfortable camp in such unforgiving conditions is no mean feat.  No doubt Jacobsen stands on the shoulders of several generations of guides and outdoorsmen yet Camping’s Top Secrets is full of original and really quite useful information.&#xA;I have certainly learned a great deal from this book and place it among the best outdoor how-to books in my library.&#xA;EXCERPTS&#xA;Storm proofing the Eureka Timberline tent with  a couple of additional guy lines and tie-outs makes a three-season tent into a four-season tent. These same principles can be applied to many tents lending them the stability of much more expensive models.&#xA;Cooking Pots&#xA;Blacken your pot bottoms: Pots that are used on open fires get quite black outside. Some experts suggest that you coat the exposed surfaces with liquid soap or shaving cream so the carbon black will clean easily. The result is an awful mess for the dish-washing crew. I leave pots black (they cook faster and more evenly) and keep them inside a plastic-lined nylon bag between uses.&#xA;Aluma Black, a chemical used to blacken aluminum gun sights and mounts, works wonders on pot bottoms. Just daub the chemical on the pot, allow it to dry, and a rich blue-black color will result. Aluma Black is available at gun shops.&#xA;Camping’s Top Secrets&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Parents We Mean To Be</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Father of three child and family psychologist Richard Weissbourd teaches at Harvard&amp;rsquo;s Kennedy School of Government and School of Education. His new book &amp;lsquo;The Parents We Mean To Be&amp;rsquo; argues  that parents have a much greater influence on their children&amp;rsquo;s moral lives than peers or popular culture.&#xA;Serving as a Scoutmaster  involves a fair amount o exposure to many different styles of parenting and I believe that Weissbourd&amp;rsquo;s ideas form a solid approach. He discusses that preoccupation with achievement, superficial happiness and attempts to befriend our children often misdirect a parent&amp;rsquo;s attempt to develop moral, balanced, functioning human beings. I was drawn to his ideas because Scouting meets Weissbourd&amp;rsquo;s prescription for good parenting. His book is available at Amazon&#xA;“What matters most as a parent is not whether my wife and I are ‘perfect’&#xA;role models or how much we talk about values, but the hundreds of ways&#xA;– as living, breathing, imperfect human beings—we influence our&#xA;children in the complex, messy relationships we have with them day to&#xA;day.”&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Many parents are narrowly focused on their children’s happiness and&#xA;believe that happiness and self-esteem are at the root of morality. We&#xA;may be the first generation of parents in history who hold that belief.&#xA;We think that a child who feels good, and who feels good about herself,&#xA;is more likely to be good. Historically, parents have thought that&#xA;suffering, burdens, and sacrifices were an important basis of morality,&#xA;that through suffering children learned empathy. But in many day-to-day&#xA;ways, we as parents place our children’s happiness above their caring&#xA;about others. We are too quick to let our kids write off friends they&#xA;find annoying. We fail to insist that they return phone calls from&#xA;friends, or give credit to other children for their achievements, or&#xA;reach out to friendless children at the playground. Or we fail to&#xA;interrupt our children when they talk too much when they’re around&#xA;other kids or adults.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Morality is comprised of many attributes—courage,&#xA;honesty, kindness, a sense of justice, moral reasoning, etc.—and there&#xA;are many different ways that adults can promote these qualities. We can&#xA;model appropriate moral behavior, help our children register kindness&#xA;and unkindness in the world around them, define clearly their&#xA;responsibilities toward others, listen responsively to their moral&#xA;dilemmas and questions, hold them to high moral standards, and develop&#xA;in them from an early age the habit of attending to and caring about&#xA;others. We can do much more to emphasize kindness rather than&#xA;happiness—rather than telling our kids all the time that the most&#xA;important thing is that they’re happy, it wouldn’t hurt to tell them&#xA;that the most important thing is that they’re kind.&#xA;But if I could give just one piece of advice to adults, it would be to&#xA;focus not on children’s happiness or self-esteem but on their&#xA;maturity&#xA;.&#xA;Maturity, including the ability to manage destructive feelings, to&#xA;balance and coordinate our needs with those of others, to receive&#xA;feedback constructively, to be reflective and self-critical—to fairly&#xA;and generously assess our behavior is the basis of both morality and&#xA;lasting well-being. It is these capacities that enable children and&#xA;adults to appreciate others despite conflicts of interest and&#xA;differences in perspective, to adhere to important principles and to&#xA;engage in sturdy, meaningful relationships and endeavors that create&#xA;lasting self-worth.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Many of us have unacknowledged fears about our children not achieving&#xA;at a high level. And because of these unrecognized fears, many of us&#xA;are quietly organizing our children’s lives around achievement and&#xA;sending inconsistent and hypocritical messages to our kids. The kids we&#xA;interviewed talked about these hypocrisies. Kids would point out, for&#xA;instance, that their parents would tell them they don’t care how much&#xA;they achieve and then pay jaw-dropping amounts of money for SAT-prep&#xA;courses. When parents tell teenagers to achieve at a high level so they&#xA;“can have options,” teenagers sniff out that their parents are talking&#xA;only about certain options—it’s not really okay for them to be&#xA;beauticians or firefighters, for example. These hypocrisies undermine&#xA;us as moral mentors. We should make achievement for our children one&#xA;theme in the larger composition of a life, and we need to understand&#xA;our own feelings better so we can have more authentic conversations&#xA;with our children about their achievements.&amp;rdquo;&#xA;&amp;ldquo;Yet the reality is that every stage of adult life can bring new moral&#xA;strengths and weaknesses, and that these changes have profound&#xA;consequences for children’s moral growth. “There is nothing noble in&#xA;being superior to somebody else,” the civil rights leader Whitney Young&#xA;said. “The only real nobility is in being superior to your former&#xA;self.” Parenting can spur either great moral growth or regression—think&#xA;of the large number of fathers who abandon their children. We send a&#xA;smug and false message to our children when we suggest that morality&#xA;simply arrives with adulthood and that all they have to do is imitate&#xA;our moral qualities and values. If we parents work at it, we can&#xA;greatly increase our own capacity for fairness, caring, and idealism,&#xA;and our developing morality will be deeply interwoven with our&#xA;children’s developing morality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Scouting Party</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/2011/04/the-scouting-party/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have spent some memorable hours reading an advance copy of David C. Scott and Brendan Murphy’s new book The Scouting Party; a thoroughly researched, unflinching account of the founding and first decade of the BSA focused on  the lives of Earnest Thompson Seton, Robert Baden-Powell and Daniel Carter Beard. To my knowledge no one has so thoroughly analyzed the events and personalities involved in the founding of the BSA.&#xA;Histories of the BSA’s early years are typically encapsulations that may mention the differences between Seton, Beard and Baden-Powell in passing but The Scouting Party takes these matters up in incredible detail mappings out the troubled relationships of these three men through their letters and writings.&#xA;Rather than legend or hagiography this account is a work of careful reportage leading to a deeper understanding of the resilient and vital ideas created in this maelstrom of personalities.The result is is an inspiring account of ideas too big for any one man’s work. Despite their deep animosities for one another Seton, Powell and Beard ultimately created a remarkable organization. Clearly such an expansive vision would never have been realized without this dynamic tension.&#xA;The calculating hand of our first National Scout Executive, James West, and the somewhat mercenary machinations of publisher William D. Boyce weave through the narrative; two men who were crucial in bringing the work of far more visionary men to a practical reality.&#xA;We learn that Seton first envisioned the key concepts central to the basis of Scouting, Baden-Powell’s disciplined pragmatism was vital in bringing Seton’s somewhat woolly, inaccessible vision, to reality and Beard’s contributions were important to popularizing the movement in its formative years.&#xA;Each of these wildly divergent personalities were all key in forming the BSA as we know it. Having a measured, scholarly look at them in their own words as they forged this organization is incredibly valuable to our collective future. As we continue work to bring the promises of Scouting to reality we will encounter similar conflicts of style, personality and ideas. We can overcome these challenges and continue to weave together a vital, relevant, movement that answers the needs of the future while remaining firmly rooted in the vision of its creation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
