Do we meet key indicators of effectively presenting our program?
The quality unit award (now the
centennial quality unit award
) has been the generally accepted standard for assessing unit program. Quality unit metrics do give some indications of the health of the program but we should take a closer look.
Quality unit metrics report adult leader training, youth recruitment and retention, parent participation, youth advancement, outdoor program participation, program planning. Meeting these indicators is somewhat like having a pulse – the unit is alive and kicking. Problem is a unit can meet these criterion with a program led and administered by adult leadership as well as one administered by youth leadership.
My choice of indicators would be a little different:
Patrol System
Patrols plan, purchase and prepare their own meals on camp outs.
The patrol leader was elected by the patrol.
Patrol leaders routinely sign off rank requirements.
Youth Leadership
Patrol leader&rsquo;s council meets regularly
Senior patrol leader is elected by Scouts
Youth plan and present weekly Troop meetings and outings
Troops that meet these key indicators will almost certainly meet or exceed the quality unit metrics but not necessarily the other way round.">

Do we meet key indicators of effectively presenting our program?
The quality unit award (now the
centennial quality unit award
) has been the generally accepted standard for assessing unit program. Quality unit metrics do give some indications of the health of the program but we should take a closer look.
Quality unit metrics report adult leader training, youth recruitment and retention, parent participation, youth advancement, outdoor program participation, program planning. Meeting these indicators is somewhat like having a pulse – the unit is alive and kicking. Problem is a unit can meet these criterion with a program led and administered by adult leadership as well as one administered by youth leadership.
My choice of indicators would be a little different:
Patrol System
Patrols plan, purchase and prepare their own meals on camp outs.
The patrol leader was elected by the patrol.
Patrol leaders routinely sign off rank requirements.
Youth Leadership
Patrol leader&rsquo;s council meets regularly
Senior patrol leader is elected by Scouts
Youth plan and present weekly Troop meetings and outings
Troops that meet these key indicators will almost certainly meet or exceed the quality unit metrics but not necessarily the other way round.</p>
