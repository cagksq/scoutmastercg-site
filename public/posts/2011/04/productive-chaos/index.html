Far easier and more productive to create productive chaos, to interrupt, re-create, produce, invent and redefine.
Seth Godin
Most of our work as Scoutmasters is like hiking a trail; start here and end up there. But things are not always that simple and organized. It&rsquo;s not always a steady pace forward. We start, stop, regroup, retreat, advance, turn around, sit down, stand still, walk, run, crawl, limp, saunter; but at least most of the time we are doing something.
There&rsquo;s a fair amount of productive chaos in Scouting (two words not often associated with one another). As a matter of fact we are specialists in productive chaos. Ideally our plans proceed in a straight, well disciplined line but that&rsquo;s hardly ever the case.
Leadership is interrupting, re-creating, inventing and redefining. Yesterday&rsquo;s plan may not work today. While the destination doesn&rsquo;t change the way we get there does.">
