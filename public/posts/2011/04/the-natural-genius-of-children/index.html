His writing on the
natural genius of children
is an excellent endorsement of Scouting;
Essentially, the real
meaning of genius
is to &ldquo;give birth to the joy&rdquo; that is within each child. Every child is
born
with that capacity. Each child comes into life with wonder, curiosity,
awe, spontaneity,
vitality, flexibility, and many other characteristics of a joyous being… These
youthful traits are
highly valued from an evolutionary perspective: the more species evolve,
the more they
carry youthful traits into adulthood (a process called &ldquo;neotony&rdquo; or
&ldquo;holding youth&rdquo;). It is imperative that we, as educators and parents,
help
preserve these genius characteristics of children as they mature into
adulthood, so those
capacities can be made available to the broader culture at a time of
incredible change.
First, and most importantly, adults need
to reawaken their
own natural genius—find within themselves the sourcewaters of their own
creativity,
vitality, playfulness, and wonder. For when children are surrounded by
curious and
creative adults, they have their own inner genius sparked into action.
Second, adults need
to provide simple activities to activate the genius of children.
Something as simple as a
story, a toy (Einstein said that a simple magnetic compass awakened his
love of learning
at the age of four), a visit to a special place, or a question, can
unlock the gates to a
child’s love of learning. Third, create a &ldquo;genial&rdquo; atmosphere at home or
school, where kids can learn in a climate free from criticism,
comparison, and pressure to
succeed. Treat each child as a unique gift from God capable of doing
wonderful things in
the world . Finally, understand that each child will be a genius in a
totally different
way from another child. Forget the standard I.Q. meaning of genius, and
use models like the
theory of multiple intelligences
to help kids succeed on their own
terms. By following
these simple guidelines for awakening each child’s natural genius, you
will be
contributing immeasurably to the welfare of your children and to the
world they will
inherit someday.">
