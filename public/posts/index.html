        Looking Ahead - Program Health
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Fifth and final entry  in a series of thoughts about
looking ahead
.
Do we meet key indicators of effectively presenting our program?
The quality unit award (now the
centennial quality unit award
) has been the generally accepted standard for assessing unit program. Quality unit metrics do give some indications of the health of the program but we should take a closer look.
Quality unit metrics report adult leader training, youth recruitment and retention, parent participation, youth advancement, outdoor program participation, program planning. Meeting these indicators is somewhat like having a pulse – the unit is alive and kicking. Problem is a unit can meet these criterion with a program led and administered by adult leadership as well as one administered by youth leadership.
My choice of indicators would be a little different:
Patrol System
Patrols plan, purchase and prepare their own meals on camp outs.
The patrol leader was elected by the patrol.
Patrol leaders routinely sign off rank requirements.
Youth Leadership
Patrol leader&rsquo;s council meets regularly
Senior patrol leader is elected by Scouts
Youth plan and present weekly Troop meetings and outings
Troops that meet these key indicators will almost certainly meet or exceed the quality unit metrics but not necessarily the other way round.</p>

        Model Scout Outing
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>“Scouting is Outing” and any lively, active Troop has an out-of-doors overnight experience planned every month of the year. Here’s a model of a typical outing that capitalizes on youth leadership and the Patrol Method.
Preparation
After the Patrol Leader’s Council (PLC) has developed a schedule of events for the year Scouts are detailed to set up the particulars of the trip. A few of the logistics are attended to by the adults ( securing campsites, various registrations etc.) but the PLC does the vast  majority of planning.
Patrols select a grubmaster for the trip who plans, purchases, packs and prepares their meals for the outing. Patrol Scribes collect fees and permission slips, the Patrol Quartermaster checks over the gear they will need and the Patrol leader administers all of these preparations.
The Senior Patrol Leader (SPL) and his cohorts form a transportation plan and oversee the preparations of the Patrols. The Troop Scribe collects money and permission slips from Patrol Scribes and develops a Troop roster for the outing. The Troop Quartermaster oversees the Patrol Quartermasters in preparing their gear. The SPL creates a schedule of activities for the outing.
Troop meetings leading up to the outing discuss any special skills or preparations for the trip. Ample time is scheduled for Patrols to complete their preparations.
Friday Night
The SPL and Patrol Leaders see that the Scouts have the proper personal gear and draw their Patrol and Troop gear from the Quartermaster, see that it is all packed properly, load everything up and move out.
Once they arrive at the campsite the SPL surveys the ground and assigns areas for each Patrol. He does his best to see that Patrols camp far enough apart to operate independently and that the adults are billeted far enough away to allow the Troop to function properly.
Before they head off to bed the PLC meets and reviews the schedule for the next day.
Saturday
The SPL and Patrol leaders get everyone up at the specified hour and breakfast is prepared. Patrols cook on their own and the Adults (who have planned and packed their own food) observe from a respectful distance.
Once breakfast is cleared away the day begins. The SPL and Patrol Leaders lead the Scouts through whatever activity is the order of the day. Adults may be invited to offer instruction (rarely) or asked to lend some oversight if the nature of the activity demands it. Otherwise the adults are pursing their own activities away from the Scouts.
Lunch and dinner happen much like breakfast as the day wears on.
The entire Troop gathers together for the first time Saturday evening. It may be a brief review of the day’s events, a campfire, a cracker-barrel or similar function.
Before everyone retires the SPL reviews Sunday’s activities with the PLC.
Sunday
Breakfast again prepared by the Patrols. It may be time to pack up, or to pursue some activity before returning home. On returning the SPL oversees the return of gear with the Quartermaster and Patrol Quartermasters.
After Action
The PLC meets to discuss the outing and what improvements can be made to their preparations or implementation. The gear is checked and cleaned if needed and the whole process is ready to begin again.
This model is just that, a model. It is based on the idea that Scouts must be given a very wide latitude to operate independent of adult interference yet with appropriate oversight. There is very little that the Scouts cannot do for themselves and they should be encouraged to do as much as they can manage.
Scouts cook on their own, camp on their own and pursue their activities on their own. Adults may be invited to participate actively, but unless they are they keep a respectful distance. How far distant? Ideally out of earshot and out of sight but close enough to be called upon if required.
Scouting is not a father or mother and son activity, not a family outing. Scouting happens when the Scouts lead themselves. When they are given autonomy and trust they respond by being responsible.</p>

        Recruiting Scouts
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>We recruit Scouts from two general populations</p>
<ol>
<li>Webelos</li>
<li>Everybody else
Webelos recruitment is simple to understand although it requires a fair amount of effort. Much has been written on Webelos transitions so I will not retrench the subject here. Here&rsquo;s discussions of the
mechanics of the process
,
retaining the Webelos you recruit
and some notes on
transitioning Webelos leaders
.
By way of review -
Find all the Webelos Dens in your community within reasonable driving distance of your Troop.
Offer them support, camping opportunities and (perhaps most importantly) Den Chiefs.
Stay in touch with them throughout the entire year, don&rsquo;t ever give up.
Recruiting Webelos takes more than it once did around here. There are fewer Webelos now than there were five or ten years ago. One of my assistant Scoutmasters maintains contact with three or four Cub Packs and we place as many Den Chiefs out there as we can in any den that wants them (Tiger through Webelos II). A Scout Troop may approach any Cub Scout Pack, there are no exclusive rights to a Cub Pack even if they share the same unit number as a Troop.
Recruiting everybody else is another story entirely.
What follows is based on twenty five years of attempting to recruit Scouts from the seventh through eighth grades. Recruiting Cub Scouts is much different and I don&rsquo;t address it here.
We get one or two new Scouts a year by the force of gravity an active Scout-led program creates. They hear about the things their friends are doing and want to join in. We don&rsquo;t actively recruit them, they just kind of show up.
I have tried the &lsquo;cold call&rsquo; methods (school visits, open houses) of recruiting Scouts for the general population over the years with very little success. Frankly I cannot recall recruiting more than one or two Scouts this way. It is tremendously little return for the effort and I don&rsquo;t know as I can recommend them to you. There are more promising ways to boost your numbers.
In my experience we recruit one Scout from every;
Ten thousand boys who see a TV commercial, print ad or yard sign.
Five hundred boys who hear a direct mass appeal like School visits.
Ten or fifteen who are approached by a friend in Scouting.
Five or ten boys who&rsquo;s parents are approached by a friend with a son in Scouting.
To my mind we should concentrate on the two most promising approaches.
One way our Troop will celebrate the centennial year of the BSA is by getting our Scouts to approach, one-on-one, 100 boys who are not Scouts.
We&rsquo;re going to record this effort by asking our Scouts to keep track of three to five contacts they make over the course of the year. We will also actively encourage parents to contact their friends with Scout-aged sons.
Is it really that simple? I don&rsquo;t really know, but we&rsquo;ll soon see.</li>

The quality of your tarp and the skill of erecting one is more crucial
on a trip then a tent. Why? It’s all about group dynamics. During foul
weather the worst thing for a group of paddlers to do is to cram tight
inside a small tent to wait out the storm. It won’t take long before
even the best of friends begin to irritate one another. But under a
tarp, with a warm fire going and a cup of tea brewing, things don’t seem
so bad – as long as you’ve put the tarp up correctly…

        The Natural Genius of Children
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Thomas Armstrong, Ph.D. has more than thirty years of teaching experience from the primary through the doctoral level. He has authored many books related to learning and human development.
His writing on the
natural genius of children
is an excellent endorsement of Scouting;
Essentially, the real
meaning of genius
is to &ldquo;give birth to the joy&rdquo; that is within each child. Every child is
born
with that capacity. Each child comes into life with wonder, curiosity,
awe, spontaneity,
vitality, flexibility, and many other characteristics of a joyous being… These
youthful traits are
highly valued from an evolutionary perspective: the more species evolve,
the more they
carry youthful traits into adulthood (a process called &ldquo;neotony&rdquo; or
&ldquo;holding youth&rdquo;). It is imperative that we, as educators and parents,
help
preserve these genius characteristics of children as they mature into
adulthood, so those
capacities can be made available to the broader culture at a time of
incredible change.
First, and most importantly, adults need
to reawaken their
own natural genius—find within themselves the sourcewaters of their own
creativity,
vitality, playfulness, and wonder. For when children are surrounded by
curious and
creative adults, they have their own inner genius sparked into action.
Second, adults need
to provide simple activities to activate the genius of children.
Something as simple as a
story, a toy (Einstein said that a simple magnetic compass awakened his
love of learning
at the age of four), a visit to a special place, or a question, can
unlock the gates to a
child’s love of learning. Third, create a &ldquo;genial&rdquo; atmosphere at home or
school, where kids can learn in a climate free from criticism,
comparison, and pressure to
succeed. Treat each child as a unique gift from God capable of doing
wonderful things in
the world . Finally, understand that each child will be a genius in a
totally different
way from another child. Forget the standard I.Q. meaning of genius, and
use models like the
theory of multiple intelligences
to help kids succeed on their own
terms. By following
these simple guidelines for awakening each child’s natural genius, you
will be
contributing immeasurably to the welfare of your children and to the
world they will
inherit someday.</p>

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>In his book, The Left Handshake Hilary St. George Saunders recounts the history of the Boy Scout Movement during the Second World War. 1939-1945. The book is available in PDF format
It is story of how scouts in occupied countries aided resistance  movements, maintained their troops and provided many public services often at great personal risk.
Poland, The Warsaw Uprising-
“After sixty-three days of bitter fighting, the insurrection was crushed, and on the 3 rd October, 1944, Warsaw fell for the second time. It was a cold, grey day, and in a house in Wilcza Street more than a hundred Scouts and Guides had gathered together. They knew it well, for some of them had helped in the hospital which had once been set up there. Now all that remained was a skeleton of scarred brick and mortar. A few were Scoutmasters who had commanded Scout units in the Home Army, but the great majority of that silent band was made up of boys and girls from the age of twelve upwards, all of whom had been heavily engaged in the fighting. They had carried messages, manned first-aid posts and fire parties, looked after homeless children, operated the Scout post office, printed and delivered newspapers, sung songs to divert terrified civilians hidden in the cellars during a bombardment, cooked for the army. There they stood in a semi-circle in the ruins of their city, and of their number forty that morning were decorated with the Cross of Merit and the Cross of Gallantry by the Chief Commissioner.”
Czechoslovakia-
“When, a few weeks before the end of the war the Germans carried out a mass migration of prisoners-of-war from east to west Czechoslovakia, Scouts near the German boundary kidnapped some sixty American prisoners-of-war who had arrived in an exhausted and starving condition, hid them in the woods and fed them till their compatriots arrived to find them alive and well, and conversing with their hosts by means of the American Indian sign language.”
Belgium-
“In the Liege district fourteen regular members of a Rover Crew, of the average age of twenty-two, set up one of the first information sections. Under cover of their Scouting activities they spied on the enemy and sent frequent reports by radio to the Allies. As the war progressed, they became expert in picking up and hiding supplies dropped to the Resistance by parachute. All these Rovers, of whom half paid for their patriotism with their lives, lived ” a tremendous adventure. ” Six escaped eventually to England, and of these, five joined the parachute troops and the other became a fighter pilot. At one time or another, ten of them were in the hands of the Gestapo, and four in those of the Spanish police. Including the seven who were executed, twelve went to concentration camps. At the end of the war the Minister of National Defence awarded a special decoration to be sewn on the flag of this splendid Troop, a unique distinction of which Belgian Scouts are justly proud.”</p>

        What happens when Scouts take over?

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Tom Gillard is a Scoutmaster in Tullahoma Tennessee. We struck up a correspondence after he was part of a session about the patrol method I presented over the internet for a group of Scouters attending a Merit Badge University. Over the past couple of months Tom has written to tell me about his experiences applying the patrol method in his Troop.
Tom is no newcomer to Scouting but he wanted to work towards strengthening his youth leadership. He shares the same reservations and doubts we all have when we really jump off into the deep end and unreservedly invest our youth leaders with real responsibility.
Here’s Tom’s latest installment – I think you’ll find it inspiring:
Our plans for this month’s outing changed suddenly leaving one week for the Patrol Leader’s Council to adapt. No sweat for them.  They don’t have the same appreciation of time that us older folks have.
Anyway we usually have an “advancement weekend” for the newly crossed over Webelos, so this is what they started planning.  The permission slips were taken up on the Monday prior to the outing so at least they knew who was going.  A couple of the older Scouts helped them plan a menu, which I wish I’d seen before I saw the Ramen noodles on Saturday night, but…anyway.
Equipment check? Almost none. We had 6 of the 9 new Scouts and 10 of the older ones going out.  I was still worried…
Monday night I sent the SPL an advancement report that outlined what each Scout needed for their next rank. I asked him to give us the most’ bang for the buck’ he could while we were camping.  He came up with a schedule and quite a few of the requirements that are best done while out in the woods.  Not bad…
No calls from anyone all week.
Saturday I was actually quite apprehensive.  The acting SPL (the real one couldn’t be there) showed up. I gave him the roster and asked him to start checking them off and when all arrived, get them to the vehicles and prepare to leave.  It worked with just a little questioning on my part.  “How many are we missing?  If we are all here shouldn’t we load up and go?”
I had most of the older Scouts in my suburban. Between their chatter on the drive to our campsite I asked them to tell me what their mission was this weekend.  One of them piped up; “If the older Scouts hadn’t helped us we wouldn’t be where we are today, so we’re here to help these new Scouts start advancing.”  I thought I should probably stop the car and wipe my teary eyes, but I said, “Good, that’s good!”  The others agreed with him.
They had said the words but could they dance the dance?  I asked more questions about how they would be doing things during the drive.
When we arrived I ran though your instructional methods with them, (circle-up, round robin, etc.)  Finally they went on their merry way…
I sat down to watch with two other ‘seasoned’ ASM’s (they are on board with the idea of the Scouts leading), and 4 ‘new’ dads.  I warned them that, while it may be painful to watch, we were letting the Scouts handle things.
With little to no prompting the older Scouts put the new Scouts into smaller groups and started instructing. Of course they forgot a lot of what I had told them about instructing earlier but I didn’t care: I was proud that they were taking charge!
I wandered around casually asking if they needed anything, then returning to my chair. One of the ASM’s was keeping the new dads busy showing them map and compass skills.
As the day progressed we adults remarked what a good job everyone was doing.  At lunch I let the Scouts know that they were doing a WONDERFUL job.  They had a 2 hour session, 2 hour lunch and then another 2 hour session then free time for the rest of the day.
On their first camping trip with the troop we have a ceremonial welcome for our new Scouts.  I had asked the older Scouts about doing this. They remembered the ceremony and wanted to do it for the new Scouts. We set out 12 candles down the road to our camp. The candles are lit and the younger scouts are led past. An older Scout is standing at each candle. He gives the Scout sign and repeats his point of the Scout law. When they reach the end of the road the new Scouts arrive at a campfire.  I had each of them pick up a stick and bring it to the campfire. I used your SM minute about sticks
The new dads were suitably impressed by the ceremony.
Most importantly I watched 6 new Scouts bond with the older Scouts during the day. The older Scouts accepted them without question and without being compelled to do so.
I commended the Scouts at every opportunity for how well they carried out the whole weekend.
I know that the next outing could very well be a complete disaster. But times like these you hope that, in their own teenage way, they are actually getting the message!
Like I’ve told you before we were around 70% youth led. I knew we could do better and it looks like our older Scouts were really capable of doing this all along. I was just scared to let go completely.  I know they can surprise you when you least expect it, but WOW what a wonderful weekend it was.
Of course there were the eggs cooked on a stove that was way to hot, the bugs that flew into our supper and the unfortunate spiders that wandered into the tent; as you said endless entertainment!
Thanks again for the support you are giving me and others!
YIS, Tom
Tom’s story is a familiar one. It takes some real courage to put the responsibility for things in the hands of the Scouts. But that’s where the responsibility belongs.
Tom wasn’t totally comfortable with this – none of us ever really are! We worry and fret over whether the Scouts are catching on. But, time and time again, they step up and surprise us with their skill and competence.
If you give your Scouts few responsibilities they’ll be a little responsible.
If you give them more responsibility they’ll be more responsible.
If you give them complete responsibility they’ll be completely responsible.</p>
