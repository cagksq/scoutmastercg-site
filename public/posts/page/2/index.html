      <p>From the introduction:
For thirty yeas B.-P. contributed to the The Scouter notes and comments under the title &ldquo;The Outlook.&rdquo; The reader turned to these first, for he knew that he would there find encouragement, advice, and inspiration — all written in that very personal style which seemed like conversation. It was in this way that B.-P. trained those who were trying to carry out Scouting for Boys. Even when a training system was begun at Gilwell, these notes continued to be the chief means by which B.-P. could pass on his ideas and suggestions to the great army of Scouters everywhere.</p>

      <p>My first reaction to this title was “yeah, right”. I’ve been a camper all my life spending a thousand or more nights under canvas or on the trail. My camping education started forty years ago with Colin Fletcher’s book ‘The Complete Walker’ and expanded to the classics written by Horace Kephart, Nessmuk, and Bradford Angier. I thought I knew all the tricks until I read ‘Camping’s Top Secrets’.
Cliff Jacobsen’s collection of techniques and ideas have been tested over many years of guiding canoe trips in northern Canada. Creating a comfortable camp in such unforgiving conditions is no mean feat.  No doubt Jacobsen stands on the shoulders of several generations of guides and outdoorsmen yet Camping’s Top Secrets is full of original and really quite useful information.
I have certainly learned a great deal from this book and place it among the best outdoor how-to books in my library.
EXCERPTS
Storm proofing the Eureka Timberline tent with  a couple of additional guy lines and tie-outs makes a three-season tent into a four-season tent. These same principles can be applied to many tents lending them the stability of much more expensive models.
Cooking Pots
Blacken your pot bottoms: Pots that are used on open fires get quite black outside. Some experts suggest that you coat the exposed surfaces with liquid soap or shaving cream so the carbon black will clean easily. The result is an awful mess for the dish-washing crew. I leave pots black (they cook faster and more evenly) and keep them inside a plastic-lined nylon bag between uses.
Aluma Black, a chemical used to blacken aluminum gun sights and mounts, works wonders on pot bottoms. Just daub the chemical on the pot, allow it to dry, and a rich blue-black color will result. Aluma Black is available at gun shops.

        Productive Chaos

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Over time, processes that seek to decrease entropy and create order are valued, but improving them gets more difficult as well. If you&rsquo;re seeking to make the organized more organized, it&rsquo;s a tough row to hoe.
Far easier and more productive to create productive chaos, to interrupt, re-create, produce, invent and redefine.
Seth Godin
Most of our work as Scoutmasters is like hiking a trail; start here and end up there. But things are not always that simple and organized. It&rsquo;s not always a steady pace forward. We start, stop, regroup, retreat, advance, turn around, sit down, stand still, walk, run, crawl, limp, saunter; but at least most of the time we are doing something.
There&rsquo;s a fair amount of productive chaos in Scouting (two words not often associated with one another). As a matter of fact we are specialists in productive chaos. Ideally our plans proceed in a straight, well disciplined line but that&rsquo;s hardly ever the case.
Leadership is interrupting, re-creating, inventing and redefining. Yesterday&rsquo;s plan may not work today. While the destination doesn&rsquo;t change the way we get there does.</p>

        Study Shows Nature Walks Alleviate ADHD Symptoms
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>This article from the New York Times reports that children with ADHD benefited from short walks in natural settings. I wonder if there are even greater benefits to a weekend in the woods?
A small study conducted at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign looked at how the environment influenced a child’s concentration skills. The researchers evaluated 17 children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, who all took part in three 20-minute walks in a park, a residential neighborhood and a downtown area.
After each walk, the children were given a standard test… The study found that children were able to focus better after the “green” walks compared to walks in other settings.
Although the study is small, the data support several earlier studies suggesting that natural settings influence psychological health. In 2004, a survey of parents of 450 children found that “green” outdoor activities reduced A.D.H.D. symptoms more than activities in other settings.
Despite the small size, the study is important because it involves an objective test of attention and doesn’t rely on children’s or parents’ impressions. During the walks, all of the children were unmedicated — participants who normally took medications to control their A.D.H.D. symptoms stayed off the drugs on the days of the walks.
The researchers found that a “dose of nature” worked as well or better than a dose of medication on the child’s ability to concentrate.</p>

        The Four Roles of Mentors
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Mentoring often goes on unnoticed in Scouting because it is so integral to the process. Here is a succinct look at four elements of mentoring. I find these particularly helpful in balancing my approach to working with our Scouts.
Recognition. “I don’t know of any test or software program that can make the kinds of subtle, personal distinctions that differentiate an interest from a burning passion. A mentor who has already found the Element in a particular discipline can do precisely that. Mentors recognize the spark of interest or delight and can help an individual drill down to the specific components of the discipline that match that individual’s capacity and passion.”
Encouragement. “Mentors lead us to believe that we can achieve something that seemed improbable or impossible to us before we met them.”
Facilitating. “Mentors can help lead us toward our Element by offering us advice and techniques, paving the way for us, and even allowing us to falter a bit while standing by to help us recover and learn from our mistakes.”
Stretching. “Effective mentors push us past what we see as our limits. Much as they don’t allow us to succumb to self-doubt, the also prevent us from doing less with our lives than we can.”

        The Parents We Mean To Be
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Father of three child and family psychologist Richard Weissbourd teaches at Harvard&rsquo;s Kennedy School of Government and School of Education. His new book &lsquo;The Parents We Mean To Be&rsquo; argues  that parents have a much greater influence on their children&rsquo;s moral lives than peers or popular culture.
Serving as a Scoutmaster  involves a fair amount o exposure to many different styles of parenting and I believe that Weissbourd&rsquo;s ideas form a solid approach. He discusses that preoccupation with achievement, superficial happiness and attempts to befriend our children often misdirect a parent&rsquo;s attempt to develop moral, balanced, functioning human beings. I was drawn to his ideas because Scouting meets Weissbourd&rsquo;s prescription for good parenting. His book is available at Amazon
“What matters most as a parent is not whether my wife and I are ‘perfect’
role models or how much we talk about values, but the hundreds of ways
– as living, breathing, imperfect human beings—we influence our
children in the complex, messy relationships we have with them day to
day.”
&ldquo;Many parents are narrowly focused on their children’s happiness and
believe that happiness and self-esteem are at the root of morality. We
may be the first generation of parents in history who hold that belief.
We think that a child who feels good, and who feels good about herself,
is more likely to be good. Historically, parents have thought that
suffering, burdens, and sacrifices were an important basis of morality,
that through suffering children learned empathy. But in many day-to-day
ways, we as parents place our children’s happiness above their caring
about others. We are too quick to let our kids write off friends they
find annoying. We fail to insist that they return phone calls from
friends, or give credit to other children for their achievements, or
reach out to friendless children at the playground. Or we fail to
interrupt our children when they talk too much when they’re around
other kids or adults.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Morality is comprised of many attributes—courage,
honesty, kindness, a sense of justice, moral reasoning, etc.—and there
are many different ways that adults can promote these qualities. We can
model appropriate moral behavior, help our children register kindness
and unkindness in the world around them, define clearly their
responsibilities toward others, listen responsively to their moral
dilemmas and questions, hold them to high moral standards, and develop
in them from an early age the habit of attending to and caring about
others. We can do much more to emphasize kindness rather than
happiness—rather than telling our kids all the time that the most
important thing is that they’re happy, it wouldn’t hurt to tell them
that the most important thing is that they’re kind.
But if I could give just one piece of advice to adults, it would be to
focus not on children’s happiness or self-esteem but on their
maturity
.
Maturity, including the ability to manage destructive feelings, to
balance and coordinate our needs with those of others, to receive
feedback constructively, to be reflective and self-critical—to fairly
and generously assess our behavior is the basis of both morality and
lasting well-being. It is these capacities that enable children and
adults to appreciate others despite conflicts of interest and
differences in perspective, to adhere to important principles and to
engage in sturdy, meaningful relationships and endeavors that create
lasting self-worth.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Many of us have unacknowledged fears about our children not achieving
at a high level. And because of these unrecognized fears, many of us
are quietly organizing our children’s lives around achievement and
sending inconsistent and hypocritical messages to our kids. The kids we
interviewed talked about these hypocrisies. Kids would point out, for
instance, that their parents would tell them they don’t care how much
they achieve and then pay jaw-dropping amounts of money for SAT-prep
courses. When parents tell teenagers to achieve at a high level so they
“can have options,” teenagers sniff out that their parents are talking
only about certain options—it’s not really okay for them to be
beauticians or firefighters, for example. These hypocrisies undermine
us as moral mentors. We should make achievement for our children one
theme in the larger composition of a life, and we need to understand
our own feelings better so we can have more authentic conversations
with our children about their achievements.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yet the reality is that every stage of adult life can bring new moral
strengths and weaknesses, and that these changes have profound
consequences for children’s moral growth. “There is nothing noble in
being superior to somebody else,” the civil rights leader Whitney Young
said. “The only real nobility is in being superior to your former
self.” Parenting can spur either great moral growth or regression—think
of the large number of fathers who abandon their children. We send a
smug and false message to our children when we suggest that morality
simply arrives with adulthood and that all they have to do is imitate
our moral qualities and values. If we parents work at it, we can
greatly increase our own capacity for fairness, caring, and idealism,
and our developing morality will be deeply interwoven with our
children’s developing morality.&rdquo;</p>

        The Scouting Party
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>I have spent some memorable hours reading an advance copy of David C. Scott and Brendan Murphy’s new book The Scouting Party; a thoroughly researched, unflinching account of the founding and first decade of the BSA focused on  the lives of Earnest Thompson Seton, Robert Baden-Powell and Daniel Carter Beard. To my knowledge no one has so thoroughly analyzed the events and personalities involved in the founding of the BSA.
Histories of the BSA’s early years are typically encapsulations that may mention the differences between Seton, Beard and Baden-Powell in passing but The Scouting Party takes these matters up in incredible detail mappings out the troubled relationships of these three men through their letters and writings.
Rather than legend or hagiography this account is a work of careful reportage leading to a deeper understanding of the resilient and vital ideas created in this maelstrom of personalities.The result is is an inspiring account of ideas too big for any one man’s work. Despite their deep animosities for one another Seton, Powell and Beard ultimately created a remarkable organization. Clearly such an expansive vision would never have been realized without this dynamic tension.
The calculating hand of our first National Scout Executive, James West, and the somewhat mercenary machinations of publisher William D. Boyce weave through the narrative; two men who were crucial in bringing the work of far more visionary men to a practical reality.
We learn that Seton first envisioned the key concepts central to the basis of Scouting, Baden-Powell’s disciplined pragmatism was vital in bringing Seton’s somewhat woolly, inaccessible vision, to reality and Beard’s contributions were important to popularizing the movement in its formative years.
Each of these wildly divergent personalities were all key in forming the BSA as we know it. Having a measured, scholarly look at them in their own words as they forged this organization is incredibly valuable to our collective future. As we continue work to bring the promises of Scouting to reality we will encounter similar conflicts of style, personality and ideas. We can overcome these challenges and continue to weave together a vital, relevant, movement that answers the needs of the future while remaining firmly rooted in the vision of its creation.</p>

        Troop Based High Adventure Programs
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>Philmont, Seabase and Northern Tier are the three most familiar national High Adventure Bases, there are dozens of other Council Based Programs.
Thousands of Scouts participate in and enjoy the big three high adventure bases each year. I have colleagues in Scouting who recommend them highly. At the other end of the high- adventure spectrum are the Troop and Crew-based programs that explore less known territory.
Our rationale for building our own high adventure program is based of a few logistic and philosophic criteria;
Time and Money
Most of the established programs involve air travel and substantial ground fees at the base itself. From our Mid-Atlantic  location the cost of participating is over $1000.00. Each also requires twelve or fourteen days including travel time. In comparison our trips cost approximately half as much and run from early Friday to the following Saturday night – consuming only  six vacation days.
Roller Coaster Vs. Bike
Most of the national programs are preplanned, preset programs that involve a minimal amount of flexibility. The dates, activities, equipment and routes are usually predetermined. There is also a good deal of competition for the best routes and times. I liken this to lining up for a roller coaster ride; buy your ticket and get in line. Troop-based high-high adventure trips are more flexible; more like getting on your bike and heading out for a ride. Not that the roller coaster isn&rsquo;t fun or challenging – it is just a different approach.
What does it take to put together a Troop based High Adventure Program? It is not so difficult as you may think. This week I&rsquo;ll be writing about our experience with the process- tomorrow we&rsquo;ll discuss how to get started.</p>

        Wilderness First Aid

    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      <p>This weekend I completed my 16 hours of Wilderness First Aid training. Crews bound for Philmont this summer must have “… at a least one person, preferably two, (either an advisor or a youth participant) in each crew be currently certified in American Red Cross Wilderness First Aid or the equivalent and CPR from the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross or the equivalent.&quot;
Our three high adventure crews are headed north to Algonquin Provincial Park in Ontario Canada this summer rather than west to Philmont but we will be in a similarly remote situation and thought it wise that we should observe the same precautions. Wilderness First Aid  prepares us for emergencies when help is some hours away.
Focused on the the prevention, recognition and response of illness and injury the course builds on basic first aid skills. Much of the time was devoted to learning and practicing how to assess, stabilize and monitor injuries. Trainees don&rsquo;t leave the course as EMT&rsquo;s or anything close but they should be capable of applying some advanced skills while waiting for help to arrive.  I wouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if WFA training became a requirement to obtain a tour permit for any Scout activity where emergency response time was four or more hours in length.
Safety on any Scouting adventure depends on good leadership. Good leadership requires a commitment to training. If your Scout Council has an active High Adventure Program they have probably arranged to offer WFA training.

“When a  person feels recognized and connected to the larger group, she knows  viscerally, not just intellectually, that she has made a contribution  others value. Not only does this motivate her to do more and try harder,  but it instills a desire to look out for the larger group…. It leads a  person to do the right thing even when no one is looking.”
Showing appreciation is part of a process he calls ‘shine&rsquo;;
Recognize effort, not just results.
Of course, you want the results, but if you recognize ongoing effort, results will more likely ensue.
Cheerleading works.
Notice details.
Generic acknowledgment pales next to specific recognition.
Provide recognition in person.
Make others look good, not bad.
Recognition is a powerful tool to preserve self-esteem.
Acknowledge people’s existence! say hello, give  a nod of the head, a high five, a smile in passing.
Tap into the power of positive feedback. Remember that positive feedback often consolidates gains better than learning from mistakes.
Monitor progress. Performance improves when a person’s progress toward a goal is monitored regularly.
Establish the habit of recognition of hard work and progress.
Bring in the marginalized people.
In most organizations,  about 15 percent of people feel unrecognized, misunderstood, devalued,  and generally disconnected. Not only is recognition good for that 15  percent to help them feel valued, it is good for the other 85 percent as  well, as it boots the positive energy across the organization.
I am not really cut out to be a cheerleader so I have to work at this sort of thing. I don&rsquo;t engage in the kind of empty, reactive, insincere praise that is often reduced to catchphrases. I do look for honest expressions of effort and take every opportunity to build on the least expression of initiative in my Scouts by recognizing them in front of their peers.
We know that a positive reaction to effort, even when it falls short of the mark, is important. Negative reactions tend to make Scouts defensive and reluctant to try again. What&rsquo;s important is not just to mouth words of encouragement but to actually be encouraging.
Scouts who get honest recognition for honest effort go on to achieve big things.</p>
