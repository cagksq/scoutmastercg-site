      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the introduction:&#xA;For thirty yeas B.-P. contributed to the The Scouter notes and comments under the title &amp;ldquo;The Outlook.&amp;rdquo; The reader turned to these first, for he knew that he would there find encouragement, advice, and inspiration — all written in that very personal style which seemed like conversation. It was in this way that B.-P. trained those who were trying to carry out Scouting for Boys. Even when a training system was begun at Gilwell, these notes continued to be the chief means by which B.-P. could pass on his ideas and suggestions to the great army of Scouters everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
